1. the AMOC index as the annual-mean maximum ocean overturning stream function between 20◦N to 70◦N from depths 200 to 3000 meters.

2. defined as the maximum streamfunction in the range of 500–4,000 m over 20°N–70°N. The streamfunction across the Atlantic basin is calculated as: 𝐴𝐴 ∫ 𝑥𝑥2 𝑥𝑥1 ∫ 0 −𝑧𝑧 𝑣𝑣𝑣𝑣𝑥𝑥𝑣𝑣𝑧𝑧, where v is the ocean meridional velocity, (x1, x2) is the western and eastern boundary of Atlantic basin
